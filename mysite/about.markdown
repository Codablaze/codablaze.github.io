I am Codablaze! I have put this blog together to make sense of the skills I am developing in Networking and IT. 

I am studying CompTIA A+, after a career spent in the events industry as a lighting rigger, stage builder and lighting programmer. 

I love technology, getting to grips with complex problems and meeting talented and knowledgeable people. The journey so far has been filled with all of this and more!
