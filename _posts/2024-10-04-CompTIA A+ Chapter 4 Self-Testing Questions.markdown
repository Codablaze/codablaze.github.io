<u>A+ Chapter 4 Self-testing questions<u>

<u>4.1 - Common cloud models<u>

❓ What is a private cloud deployment?<br>
✅ **When you own all the equipment, and control access to the building, also supplying hardward, virtualisation, platform and application.** 

❓ What is a public cloud deployment?<br>
✅ **When you rent hardware, platform or software from a company whose services are open to everyone.**

❓ What is a hybrid cloud deployment?<br>
✅ **A combination of private and public, for greater flexibility and efficiency. Core systems might be on your own hardware, with temporary expansions being deployed on public cloud services.**

❓ What is a community deployment?<br>
✅ **When a group of organisations band together to deploy their services through the cloud, using any of the configurations listed above.**

❓ What is IaaS?<br>
✅ **Infrastructure as a Service, most often associated with renting out the equipment in a data centre (often to a HaaS provider), but not handling customer information, or being responsible for any applications.**

❓ What is HaaS?<br>
✅ **Hardware as a Service. People or organisations can rent specific hardware as per their requirements, but you are not responsible for software running on that hardware.**

❓ What is SaaS?<br>
✅ **Software available to use on the cloud, perhaps where you may want to use a more powerful machine than your own. Game streaming is a good example.**

❓ What is PaaS?<br>
✅ **Platform as a service. Gmail, YouTube, Hotmail and Facebook are all examples of a platform as as service.**

❓ What does VDI stand for?<br>
✅ **Virtualised Desktop Infrastructure?**

<br>

<u>4.2 - Client side virtualisation<u>

❓ When was virtualisation first used?<br>
✅ **1967, by IBM**

❓ What are the benefits of VMs and legacy software?<br>
✅ **They can be used to safely house legacy software with none of the problems associated with maintaining an older machine.**

❓ What is cross-platform virtualisation?<br>
✅ **Running multiple OSs - for example, Windows in a Mac, Linux in a Mac, alongside the native OS.**

❓ What is a hypervisor?<br>
✅ **The name given to the software co-ordinating VMs. Virtual Box is a hypervisor.**

❓ What is VT?<br>
✅ **Intel's CPU level virtualisation technology.**

❓ What is AMD-V?<br>
✅ **AMD's CPU level virtualisation technology.**

❓ What is meant by sandboxing in cloud computing and VMs?<br>
✅ **Creating a safe environment to experiment with and test things out.**

❓ What is a VM snapshot?<br>
✅ **Like a system image, but quicker. You can roll back to an earlier state if you mess something up at the click of a button.**

❓ What is a primary security concern when using VMs?<br>
✅ **VM escaping, or not knowing what software may be running on a pre-made VM.**

❓ What is a rogue VM?<br>
✅ **A VM created by a hacker to exploit vulnerabilities in your system.**

❓ What is a shared network address?<br>
✅ **The VM and the host machine share the sam IP address.**

❓ What is a bridged network address?<br>
✅ **The VM has its own assigned IP address.**

❓ What is a private address?<br>
✅ **The VM is totally cut off from the real network.**
