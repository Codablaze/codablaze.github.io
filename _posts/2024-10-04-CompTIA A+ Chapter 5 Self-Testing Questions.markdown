<u>A+ Chapter 5 Self-testing questions<u>

<u>5.1 - Apply best practice methodology to resolve problems<u>

❓ What is ‘change management’?<br>
✅ **A system whereby the network is only changed once a pre-agreed process has been followed**

❓ What are the 6 stages of change management?<br>
✅ **Plan**<br>
✅ **Estimate**<br>
✅ **Risk assess**<br> 
✅ **Recovery plan**<br> 
✅ **Test**<br>
✅ **Document**<br>
✅ **Make change**

❓ What is the troubleshooting process?<br>
✅ **Identify the problem**<br>
✅ **Establish a theory**<br>
✅ **Test the theory**<br>
✅ **Evaluate results - is it working? > return to step 2 if not**<br>
✅ **Establish a plan of action**<br>
✅ **Implement the plan**<br>
✅ **Verify full system functionality**<br>
✅ **Document findings**<br>

❓ What are some pitfalls when identifying a problem?<br>
✅ **A user may not be able to give you all the info you need**

❓ Why should you question users directly?<br>
✅ **The email, or ticket they sent, may leave out crucial information**

❓ When should you perform a backup during a troubleshoot?<br>
✅ **At the beginning, before making any changes**

❓ Why should you not rely only on information from a user about an issue?<br>
✅ **Other factors that the user may no be aware of may be to blame, such as network cabling being damaged**

❓ Who could you ask and what could you check to collect more information before starting a troubleshoot?<br>
✅ **Colleagues, manufacturer's documentation, or anyone else working with that equipment to see what they have noticed**

❓ What is a change control window?<br>
✅ **A preset window of system downtime where live changes can happen. This may be a company shutdown day or even just a couple of hours**
