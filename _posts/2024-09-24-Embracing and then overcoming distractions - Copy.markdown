Last week was a sort of 'free jazz' era of study. I configured servers, rebuilt laptops, got to grips with git, jekyll, ruby, a ton of
different Linux distros, and burned hours upon hours trying to get one particular old machine working, despite the fact that something
seemed to be internally fried. I eventually settled to have it running a 32 bit version of Linux called Puppy, and I am okay with that.

Sort of.

I realised over the weekend, however, that I was becoming distracted, ironically, by my own enthusiasm.

I started to spend a lot of study time looking at organisations I could work for, watching PC build videos and playing PC building simulator,
kind of telling myself that it was okay because it all fed into 'The Learning'.

In this case, 'The Learning' had developed into a devilish and greedy catch-all term that pulled me away from direct CompTIA+ study, and just 
basically all over the place. 

I lost an entire day to PC building simulator, and a whole morning learning Python. When I eventually went back to the beginning of the 
Professor Messer video series, I found that I had retained very little. It was disheartening, and I began to feel a little lost - as though
I'd allow myself to free-wheel with the academic freedom.

With that in mind, I resolved to refocus my attention.

I started, ironically, not by diving back into the course content, but by watching a podcast all about peer-reviewed enhanced study techniques.
I won't link it here, because I am not writing this blog to sell study ideas, but the upshot was all about ways to encourage neuroplasticity,
optimum study periods, and general habits to improve information retention; many of which seem very counterintuitive, but I think are working.

Using these techniques (removing distractions, managing expectations of friends and family, leaving my phone in another room, 
cold plunging, periodic, simple format open-ended self-testing, NSDR (Non Sleep Deep Rest) and ten minutes of focus-trained mindfulness per day), 
I feel like my information retention is significantly higher than before.

Will this work? I can't know until I take my first exam, however, I feel more focused, engaged and in control of my study than before. And have
a clear idea of how to approach the course with a specific vie to passing the exam. All the fun supplementary stuff can be done in my own time, 
rather than shakily tying my tech-tinkering to a broader sense of frenetic learning.

My head hurts now though! Ha!
