So, I have now set up a DNS Server on my Virtual Home Network. I am going to refer to this setup as 'The Lab' from now on,
because that is a term I hear bandied around quite a bit. 

I'll be honest, I didn't fully understand what a DNS Server was 'for' at first. I did read about it, but a lot of the explanations
I found were very technical in nature. I now know that a DNS Server (Domain Name System Server) is simply a way of allowing humans
to interact with a network more easily. Committing pure IP addresses to memory and recalling them accurately is difficult for people,
but setting up a domain with a name (in my case, codablaze.com) makes it very simple to reference, find, test, log and connect to.

Update:
I have set up a second DNS server on another machine, running a separate set of VMs. This process was a lot smoother, and I challenged
myself to do it from memory. I did refer back to a tutorial when setting up the 'www' section, as that didn't make immediate sense
(it turned out I just had to right-click in an empty space).

The DNS Servers are both running in conjunction with the DHCP Server from my last post (I replicated that on the second machine as well).

Here is a link to the tutorial I used:

msftwebcast.com is my guru with this particular collection of setups.
